My game is going to be a shooting scroller titled "LM10: Rondaldo's Revenge", the first of many 
installments of the LM10 franchise. Leo Messi has had his Ballon d'Or stolen by Ronaldo and he
is trying to get it back. Messi must dodge and defeat a number of rivals as he dribbles his way
to glory and reclaims his trophy. 

There are two types of levels -- "normal" levels and a boss level (Ronaldo). To finish the
normal levels, you must navigate your way through sliding defenders, goal keepers, unruly 
fans, etc. as they move from the top of the screen to the bottom, where Messi is positioned.
The defenders and goalkeepers will have no AI; they will run on set cycles. Messi can also
shoot soccer balls at obstacles to destroy them. 

The boss level will feature Ronaldo; Messi must defeat him by avoiding his projectiles and
shooting soccer balls at him. Ronaldo is different from the other enemies that Messi encounters
in that he is stronger (takes more shots to kill), and shoots harder (does more damage) and 
faster. He also shoots at Messi's position as opposed to randomly. He can also dodge some of
Messi's shots.In general, Ronaldo has better AI.
